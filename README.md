# Advent of Code Go Solutions

## Summary
---

These are my solutions for the Advent of Code challenges. I'm using these to
practice Computer Science topics and Go. Hopefully to gain a greater
understanding of the language through these challenges.

These are intended to act as a reference and to display of progress as to how
much I have learned about the Go programming language.
